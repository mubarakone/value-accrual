You're on the right track ‚Äî **ETH is *partially* becoming this ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù asset**, but it‚Äôs **not fully there yet**. Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs happening now versus the vision you described, and where the gaps still lie.

---

## ‚úÖ **What‚Äôs Already Happening (2025)**

### 1. **ETH as Gas + Settlement Asset**

* ETH **remains the native gas token** for Ethereum mainnet and some L2s (like Base, Optimism, etc.).
* It's the default **settlement currency** for validators and block proposers.
* With **EIP-1559** still burning base fees, ETH acts as a **utility + deflationary asset**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Progress toward ETH as infrastructure money.**

---

### 2. **ETH Is Widely Used in DeFi Liquidity**

* ETH is still a **core trading pair** on major DEXs (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer).
* **WETH (wrapped ETH)** is used even more than ETH itself for DeFi integrations.
* Some protocols still **quote prices in ETH**, especially for NFTs and older DeFi apps.

‚û°Ô∏è **ETH is already a major liquidity hub ‚Äî but not the only one.**

---

### 3. **ETH as a Preferred Collateral Asset**

* ETH is **heavily used in lending protocols** like Aave, Maker, Compound.
* ETH backs over **50% of the DAI supply** via MakerDAO.
* LSTs (e.g., stETH, ETHx) are growing, adding utility layers.

‚û°Ô∏è ETH is becoming more than just money ‚Äî it's **financial infrastructure**.

---

## ‚ùå **What‚Äôs Still Missing**

### 1. **Stablecoins Still Dominate**

* Most trading volume and DeFi activity is still quoted in **USD-pegged stablecoins** (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI).
* Most users prefer **price stability** over ETH volatility.
* DEXs route many trades through **USDC, not ETH**, especially in stablecoin pairs.

‚û°Ô∏è **ETH is not yet the universal routing asset.** Stablecoins are.

---

### 2. **Some L2s Use ETH, Others Don‚Äôt**

* Optimism and Base use ETH for gas.
* But Arbitrum, zkSync, Starknet are experimenting with **custom gas tokens or fee models**.

‚û°Ô∏è ETH is **not yet the universal gas or liquidity token across L2s**.

---

### 3. **ETH is Not the Liquidity Standard (Yet)**

* Many token pairs still prefer **stablecoin routing** (e.g., DAI ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí XYZ).
* Aggregators like 1inch, Matcha often choose **lowest slippage route**, not necessarily via ETH.

‚û°Ô∏è ETH is **a key router** ‚Äî but **not the default for all liquidity paths**.

---

### 4. **Bridges Still Use Stablecoins**

* Cross-chain bridges often use stablecoins like USDC/USDT for transfer.
* Even ETH bridges (like Hop or Across) sometimes prioritize stablecoin routes for UX.

‚û°Ô∏è ETH hasn‚Äôt yet become the **standard cross-domain currency**.

## üöÄ What Would Need to Happen

For ETH to *fully* become the "black hole" of the network:

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **More trading pairs use ETH as base**    | More DEXs default to ETH pairs instead of stablecoin pairs.                    |
| **Stable ETH-pegged alternatives emerge** | Products like **RAI, LSDfi**, or volatility-buffered ETH assets gain traction. |
| **ETH used across all rollups for gas**   | Rollups adopt ETH as native gas token and fee market.                          |
| **ETH becomes universal bridge asset**    | ETH is used for cross-chain transactions and liquidity by default.             |
| **Stablecoin dominance decreases**        | Users start preferring ETH-backed primitives for savings and transacting.      |

---

## üß† Summary

**ETH is on the path** to becoming the gravitational center of Ethereum ‚Äî but it's **not there yet**.

* **Today**: ETH is a strong utility token, gas token, and DeFi collateral.
* **Not yet**: The *default routing, bridging, and quoting asset* across the stack.

It‚Äôs more of a **proto‚Äìblack hole**, and it‚Äôs growing ‚Äî but **stablecoins still dominate the day-to-day liquidity flows**.

**The transition is possible**, and maybe even likely ‚Äî but only if user demand, UX, and protocol incentives shift toward using ETH as the primary medium of exchange *instead* of just a store of value or collateral.
